# Day 3: Advanced Vue Features & Navigation

## Task 1: Category-Based Navigation

Update the navigation to support categories. Move the clock-related pages under a Clock category.

**Requirements:**
- Organize existing clock functionality under a "Clock" category
- Implement nested/grouped navigation structure
- Maintain responsive design

## Task 2: Calculator Application

Create a new calculator page supporting basic mathematical operations.

**Requirements:**
- Support division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and parentheses
- Use Windows calculator as a design reference
- Support both GUI button clicks and keyboard input (Google calculator style)
- Implement calculation history with ability to restore previous calculations
- Display current calculation and result clearly

**Mathematical Operations:**
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, ×, ÷
- Parentheses for order of operations
- Clear/reset functionality
- Error handling for invalid operations

## Task 3: Vue Reactivity Research

Update this README with your findings on Vue reactivity patterns found in real-world applications.

**Research Focus:**
- Document examples of different types of refs, computeds, and reactives
- Find patterns in open-source Vue projects
- Identify common use cases and best practices
- Note any interesting or unexpected implementations

**Deliverable:** Add a new section below with your research findings, including:
- Code examples (with source attribution)
- Use case descriptions
- Personal observations or insights

## Getting Started

Create a new branch for day 3 work building off your existing day-2 branch:

```bash
git checkout feature/yourname-day-2
git pull origin feature/yourname-day-2
git checkout -b feature/yourname-day-3
```

Complete Tasks 1 and 2, committing and pushing your changes as you go.

## Final Step

Once you've completed all tasks, raise a new PR from your `-day-3` branch against your day-2 branch (e.g., `feature/yourname-day-3` → `feature/yourname-day-2`). Include your Task 3 research findings in the PR description or as commits to this README.

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
